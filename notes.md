# Figma and Web Design Summary

## General

### General

- First thing's first: I'm NOT a designer. I know how to design, but I don't
  have the patience for it and I don't like going back and forth forever with
  clients about what they want

- I should allways tell clients that I'm not a designer. I can do basic things
  that might be needed, though

- I use Figma and other design tools mostly for planning, cooperation, etc

- When most people think of a designer, they think of a "master designer" that
  does nothing but design, and these are the results that they expect. I don't
  want to do that

- I have a long summary of Figma (in Hebrew) in my Excels. I can copy it to here
  if I'll have the time to

- Usually, clients need a designer that speaks their language. That's because
  they need to communicate a lot, do a lot of back and forth, etc

- Note: There are a lot of Figma plugins for converting Figma designs to
  Elementor\Guttenberg. They don't work 100% right, but they still can save some
  time
